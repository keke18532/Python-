A program in which you define a function, which receives a list of values
x0, x1, x2,...xn and calculates the value of y in the following formula:
y=âˆ‘sin2(xn) -log(xn,3)+1/pow(xn,5), for n=0,1,2,...

A program, which finds and displays the total price of all products from the following text.
The price for each product is calculated by multiplying the amount of the product by its unit price:

A program in which you define a function for encrypting texts so that
it receives a text and converts 'flower' to 'garlic' and prints out the resulting text.
'''
text=input('Please input a sentence which includes flower:\n')
text1=text.replace('flower','garlic')

A program, which finds all the indexes of word 'flower' in the following text: "A flower is a beautiful plant,
which can be planted in the garden or used to decorate home.
One might like a flower for its colors and the other might like a flower for its smell. A flower typically symbolizes soft feelings".
